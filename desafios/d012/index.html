            Here in the Garden
            Let's play a game
            I'll show you how it's done
            Here in the Garden
            Stand very still
            [SPINEL]
            This'll be so much fun

            And then she smiled
            That's what I'm after
            A smile in her eyes
            The sound of her laughter
            Happy to listen
            Happy to play
            Happily watching her drift away

            Happily waiting
            All on my own
            Under the endless sky
            Counting the seconds
            Standing alone
            As thousands of years go by
            Happily wondering
            Night after night
            Is this how it works?
            Am I doing it right?
            Happy to listen
            Happy to stay
            Happily watching her drift away

            You keep on turning pages for people who don't care
            People who don't care about you
            And still, it takes you ages to see that no one's there
            See that no one's there
            See that no one's there
            Everyone's gone on without you

            Finally something
            Finally news
            About how the story ends
            She doesn't exist now
            Survived by her son
            And all of her brand new friends
            Isn't that lovely?
            Isn't that cool?
            And isn't that cruel
            And aren't I a fool to have
            Happily listened
            Happy to stay
            Happily watching her drift
            Drift
            Drift away
